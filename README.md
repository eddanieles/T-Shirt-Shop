# T-Shirt-Shop

This is the link to clone the repository: https://github.com/eddanieles/T-Shirt-Shop.git

I feel I did okay on this assignment. The parts that are missing is the transition and arrows on the submenu. I did provide an example of a transition, the color of the icons display a 2 second change.

I didn't get a chance to play around with the javascript. I think it will look something like:

    $("fa-undo").on("click", function(){
      $("this").addClass("shirt_back");
    });

    $("fa-undo").on("click", function(){
      $("this").removeClass("shirt_front");
    });
